# Visual Query Builder - Development Scripts

These scripts help you manage the development environment, especially useful after computer sleeps or when you need a fresh start.

## Quick Commands

### ðŸ”„ Fresh Start (Recommended after sleep/restart)
```bash
./scripts/fresh-start.sh
```
Complete clean + rebuild + start. Use this when:
- Computer woke up from sleep
- Servers seem stuck or unresponsive
- You want a completely clean environment

### ðŸš€ Start Servers
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```
Start both backend (port 3000) and frontend (port 5173) servers.

### ðŸ›‘ Stop Servers
```bash
./scripts/stop.sh
```
Stop all running servers.

### ðŸ“‹ View Logs
```bash
./scripts/logs.sh
```
Monitor server logs and status.

## Individual Commands

### ðŸ§¹ Clean Only
```bash
./scripts/clean.sh
```
Remove node_modules, build artifacts, and temp files.

### ðŸ”¨ Rebuild Only
```bash
./scripts/rebuild.sh
```
Install dependencies and build the project.

## Typical Workflow

1. **After computer sleep/restart:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fresh-start.sh
   ```

2. **Normal development:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh    # Start servers
   # ... do your work ...
   ./scripts/stop.sh     # Stop when done
   ```

3. **If servers get stuck:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop.sh
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

4. **If weird issues persist:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fresh-start.sh
   ```

## What Each Script Does

- **clean.sh**: Kills processes, removes node_modules, clears build artifacts
- **rebuild.sh**: Fresh npm install and build
- **start.sh**: Starts both servers with health checks
- **stop.sh**: Gracefully stops all servers
- **logs.sh**: Shows server status and logs
- **fresh-start.sh**: Runs clean â†’ rebuild â†’ start in sequence

## Access URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health
