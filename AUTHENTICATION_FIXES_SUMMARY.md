# Authentication Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the authentication and connection fixes implemented to resolve the issues identified in the guidance from the external agent.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Proxy Target Construction (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: `http-proxy` throwing `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'split')` due to missing protocol/host.

**Solution**: Updated proxy middleware to dynamically construct target URL from forwarded headers:
```javascript
target: (req) => {
  const host = req.headers['x-forwarded-host'];
  const proto = req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] || 'https';
  
  if (!host) {
    const fallbackHost = process.env.DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME;
    if (!fallbackHost) {
      throw new Error('Neither x-forwarded-host header nor DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME environment variable is available');
    }
    return `https://${fallbackHost}`;
  }
  
  const target = `${proto}://${host}`;
  return target;
}
```

### 2. Authentication Logic in Apps Mode (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Code was still gating on local environment tokens in Databricks Apps mode.

**Solution**: Updated `getUserToken()` function to properly prioritize forwarded headers:
- In Databricks Apps: Uses `x-forwarded-access-token` header
- In local development: Falls back to `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variable
- Added validation to ensure Apps mode requests have proper forwarded headers

### 3. Warehouse ID Validation (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: "DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID is not configured" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated environment validation to require `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` in Apps mode
- Added `getDynamicDatabricksHost()` function for dynamic host construction
- Updated warehouse status and Unity Catalog test endpoints to use dynamic hosts

### 4. Unity Catalog Authorization Headers (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Unity Catalog calls going through proxy without bearer tokens.

**Solution**: Enhanced proxy middleware to:
- Always forward `Authorization: Bearer <x-forwarded-access-token>`
- Forward all relevant Databricks Apps headers (`x-databricks-org-id`, `x-forwarded-user`, `x-forwarded-email`)
- Proper error handling for missing forwarded tokens

### 5. Base URL Construction (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: Hardcoded localhost assumptions in Apps mode.

**Solution**: 
- Dynamic host construction from `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers
- Fallback to environment variables when headers not available
- Consistent host resolution across all endpoints

## Key Changes Made

### Server.js
- **Proxy Middleware**: Dynamic target construction with proper error handling
- **Authentication**: Consistent use of forwarded tokens in all endpoints
- **Header Forwarding**: Complete forwarding of Databricks Apps headers
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for missing authentication

### Auth-utils.js
- **Environment Detection**: Enhanced detection logic for Databricks Apps
- **Token Extraction**: Proper prioritization of forwarded headers over environment variables
- **Dynamic Hosts**: New function for building hosts from request headers
- **Validation**: Updated environment validation for Apps mode

### Database Connection
- **Dynamic Hosts**: Uses dynamic host construction for Apps mode
- **Authentication**: Consistent use of forwarded user tokens
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for connection issues

## Testing

### Test Script
Updated `scripts/test-auth.js` to test the new authentication flow:
- Health endpoint testing
- Configuration endpoint testing
- Authentication endpoint testing
- Unity Catalog endpoint testing
- Proper error handling validation

### Manual Testing
To test the fixes:

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-pat-token"
   export DATABRICKS_HOST="your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
   export DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID="your-warehouse-id"
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Databricks Apps**:
   - Deploy the app to Databricks Apps
   - Ensure "sql" scope is enabled
   - Verify forwarded headers are present

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### In Databricks Apps Mode
- ✅ No more `null.split()` errors
- ✅ Proper authentication via forwarded headers
- ✅ Dynamic host construction from forwarded headers
- ✅ Unity Catalog calls work with proper authorization
- ✅ Warehouse operations use user's permissions

### In Local Development Mode
- ✅ Fallback to environment variable authentication
- ✅ Static host configuration
- ✅ PAT-based authentication
- ✅ Warehouse operations use configured credentials

## Configuration Requirements

### Databricks Apps Environment
```yaml
env:
  - name: 'DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID'
    value: 'your-warehouse-id'
  - name: 'DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME'
    value: 'your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com'
  - name: 'NODE_ENV'
    value: 'production'
```

### Local Development Environment
```bash
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-pat-token"
export DATABRICKS_HOST="your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
export DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID="your-warehouse-id"
export NODE_ENV="development"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Databricks Apps** to test the fixes
2. **Verify forwarded headers** are being received
3. **Test Unity Catalog endpoints** to ensure they work
4. **Monitor logs** for any remaining authentication issues
5. **Test warehouse operations** with user permissions

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Key Log Messages to Watch For
- `[PROXY] Target URL: https://...` - Shows dynamic host construction
- `[PROXY] Auth header present: true` - Confirms authentication forwarding
- `✅ Using x-forwarded-access-token from Databricks Apps` - Confirms Apps mode detection

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Missing forwarded headers**: Ensure app is properly installed with "sql" scope
- **Warehouse ID errors**: Verify `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` is set in app.yaml
- **Host resolution errors**: Check `DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME` configuration

## Conclusion

These fixes address all the major authentication and connection issues identified in the guidance:
- ✅ Dynamic proxy target construction
- ✅ Proper Apps mode authentication
- ✅ Warehouse ID validation
- ✅ Unity Catalog authorization
- ✅ Dynamic base URL construction

The app should now work properly in both Databricks Apps and local development environments, with proper authentication and connection handling.
